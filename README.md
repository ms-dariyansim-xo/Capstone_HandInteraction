<!--Codes not yet executed as another repo has been created for practice and trials, did not want to
prolong confusion with the utilization of Node.js, as it cannot be used as database (as intented) WITHOUT
using an actual DB. Reading MONGOdb as highly used for concept for my project.

So far, Node execution has been successful, using MySQL as it is what I've learned and needed to improve on.
MySQL is used for tables to categorize each content of basic ASL;
-ABCs
-Colors
-Animals

Code talks struggles are video recording, previously used OBS and intended to upload to unlisted YT page, micophone functions and new camera installed.

Made changes to documentations shortly after graded, but did not update in index.

Interactive inspired concept changed to generalized public "browsing" page, still exposing ASL and initially wanted to create particular "social media" platform for deaf audience. 

YAML(?) - another lang. required to learn how to use in Deep Learning for AI (future goals)-->
